## Problem It Solves
The problem this project solves is the lack of experience and confidence that new investors face when trying to invest in the stock market. By providing a simulated trading environment with dummy stocks, new investors can practice trading without risking real money. This will give them the opportunity to learn about the stock market and develop trading strategies without the fear of losing their hard-earned money. Additionally, providing information about real stocks will help new investors make informed decisions when they eventually transition to trading with real money. Also this project provides some financial information. Site provides some financial planning tools using that one can achieve financial stability.

## Project Description
Wealthwise is a user-friendly platform for both stock market enthusiasts and investors in Indian and American markets. Without worrying about losing actual money, one can practise trading on this platform with virtual dummy stocks. The real-time stock data Wealthwise offers is one of its primary benefits. Users who want to make wise investing decisions can check the most recent prices, price charts, and advice. Due to the real-time updating of this data, customers are able to keep up with market movements and use the watchlist tool to make timely judgements. 

By paying a little fee inside the system, one can borrow money or obtain a loan without using an external platform. In the account and portfolio section, you may view all of the transactions and analyses along with the necessary charts. For investments and financial security, there are various financial calculators available, including SIP Calculator. Every page has an information button that links to financial information. Additionally, the platform offers an intuitive user interface with a theme selector and simple light and dark mode switching.

The overall goals of Wealthwise are to lower the entry barrier for new investors and to advance financial literacy. Users can develop expertise and confidence in the stock market and learn about smart financial management by providing a simulated trading environment, real-time stock data, the most recent news, several calculators, and a lending system.
